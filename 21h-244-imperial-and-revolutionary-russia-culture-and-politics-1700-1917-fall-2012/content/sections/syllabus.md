Description
-----------

At the beginning of the 18th century Russia began to come into its own as a major European power. Members of the Russian intellectual classes increasingly compared themselves and their autocratic order to states and societies in the West. This comparison generated both a new sense of national consciousness and intense criticism of the existing order in Russia. In this course we will examine different perspectives on Russian history and literature in order to try to understand the Russian Empire as it modernized from Peter the Great to the Russian Revolution.

Students are asked to write short papers of approximately 1–2 pages responding to the readings (6 in all). In addition you will write one 8–10 page research paper, due session 19. Each student will lead one class with questions prepared in advance for everyone to consider. At the end of the course there will be a final examination.
